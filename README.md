### TOB Overview

This is a fork of Eldarion's Symposion conference software that is being developed for use by The Open Bastion. The intent is not only to use the version housed in this repo in our own activities but also to contribute code back to the original project. All modifications should be considered under the original project license (BSD; included), however the original project is well-maintained and should be considered the default choice for non-TOB users.

## Symposion

A conference management solution from Eldarion.

Built with the generous support of the Python Software Foundation.

See http://eldarion.com/symposion/ for commercial support, customization and hosting
